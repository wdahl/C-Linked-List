#C-Linked-List
This is an interactive C program that prompts the user for commands, accepts commands from the keyboard (stdin) and executes those commands. When a command requires output, it is written to stdout. The program will continue to accept and process commands until the user types the end command.
Assumptions:
	The command given by the user will be one of ina, inb, del, rep, prn, or end.
	Each command will contain all and only the necessary arguments.
	Each string specified in a command wont't include any whitespace characters.
